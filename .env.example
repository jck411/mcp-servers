# MCP Servers — Environment Configuration
#
# Copy to .env on the deploy target:
#   cp .env.example .env
#
# Port map (reference only — ports are set per-instance, see below)
# shell_control=9001  housekeeping=9002  calculator=9003  calendar=9004
# gmail=9005  gdrive=9006  pdf=9007  monarch=9008  notes=9009
# spotify=9010  playwright=9011  kiosk_clock_tools=9012
#
# The systemd template uses per-instance env files for ports:
#   .env.calculator   → MCP_PORT=9003
#   .env.shell_control → MCP_PORT=9001
#   .env.playwright   → MCP_PORT=9011
#
# Run deploy/setup-systemd.sh to generate these automatically.
# This main .env file is for shared settings used by ALL servers.
